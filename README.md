## Work Performed
I was provided with three key components:
- **TreasureMaze.py:** The maze environment with state updates, valid actions, and reward logic.  
- **GameExperience.py:** Experience replay class handling episode storage and target computation.  
- **Notebook Skeleton:** A Jupyter Notebook with setup code and `#TODO` placeholders for the Q-learning implementation.

I implemented the core deep Q-learning agent:
- Completed the `qtrain` function with epsilon-greedy exploration, memory replay, and model updates.  
- Designed and compiled the neural network model in Keras.  
- Developed evaluation utilities (`play_game`, `completion_check`) and plotting routines to visualize training progress and win rates.

## Connection to Computer Science
Computer science transforms real-world challenges into formal models and builds algorithms and software to solve them efficiently and reliably. From scientific simulations to consumer applications, this discipline enables innovation, automation, and large-scale data processing that drive modern technology.

## Problem-Solving Approach
1. **Define** clear objectives and success metrics.  
2. **Model** the environment and data structures.  
3. **Design** or select appropriate algorithms (e.g., reinforcement learning for sequential decision-making).  
4. **Implement** incrementally, testing each component thoroughly.  
5. **Evaluate** outcomes against benchmarks and visualize results.  
6. **Refine** through hyperparameter tuning, optimization, and alternative method exploration.

## Ethical Responsibilities
- **Transparency:** Document assumptions, limitations, and decision-making processes to maintain stakeholder trust.  
- **Fairness:** Identify and mitigate biases in data and reward structures to prevent harmful behaviors.  
- **Accountability:** Ensure reproducibility, version control, and auditability for responsible maintenance.  
- **Security & Integrity:** Protect code and data from unauthorized access or tampering to safeguard user trust and organizational reputation.
